# docker-create-react-app
## Verified to work in Release
This project was created internally at Release. It uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
running inside of a [Docker]() container to display a simple landing page. This landing page is functional without an API, but this project can be combined with the [rails_postgres_redis](https://github.com/awesome-release/rails_postgres_redis), which is another Awesome Release project. See the Release documentation on [How to Import Apps]() for combining both projects.

To make this project run in [Release](https://releaseapp.io), simply create a new application with this repository.
